# Super-Store-Sales
A sales dashboard made with Power BI shows colorful pictures and numbers about how much stuff a company sells. It helps managers quickly see important information, like how much money they're making, what products are popular, and where they're selling the most. This helps them make smart decisions to sell more and make their business better.
